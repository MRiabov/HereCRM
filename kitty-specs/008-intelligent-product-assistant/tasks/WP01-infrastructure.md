## Review Feedback

**Status**: ❌ **Needs Changes**

**Key Issues**:

1. **Missing Files**: `src/assets/channels.yaml` and `src/assets/manual.md` do not exist.
2. **Missing Implementation**: `src/config.py` does not contain `ChannelSettings`, `ChannelsConfig`, or `load_channels_config`.
3. **Missing Implementation**: `src/llm_client.py` does not contain the `chat_completion` method.

**Action Items**:

- [ ] Implement T001: Create and populate `src/assets/channels.yaml`.
- [ ] Implement T002: Add Pydantic models and loader in `src/config.py`.
- [ ] Implement T003: Add `chat_completion` to `LLMClient` in `src/llm_client.py`.
- [ ] Implement T004: Create `src/assets/manual.md`.

# WP01: Infrastructure & Configuration

**Goal**: Establish the configuration headers and base classes required for channel-specific behavior and raw LLM text generation.

## Context

We are building an "Intelligent Product Assistant" that uses RAG. Before implementing the logic, we need to set up the configuration for different channels (e.g. WhatsApp needs short answers, Email can be long) and ensure our `LLMClient` supports raw text generation (currently it might be focused on tool calling).

## Subtasks

### T001: Create `src/assets/channels.yaml`

- Create a new file `src/assets/channels.yaml`.
- Define a structure for channel configurations.
- **Content**:

  ```yaml
  whatsapp:
    max_length: 150
    style: "concise"
  email:
    max_length: 1000
    style: "detailed"
  sms:
    max_length: 160
    style: "very concise"
  ```

### T002: Implement `ChannelConfig` loader

- Edit `src/config.py`.
- Create Pydantic models `ChannelSettings` (max_length, style) and `ChannelsConfig` (dict of channel names to settings).
- Implement a function `load_channels_config() -> ChannelsConfig` that reads `src/verify_assets/channels.yaml` (or `src/assets/channels.yaml`, verify project convention).
- Ensure it handles missing file gracefully (default to generic settings).

### T003: Update `LLMClient`

- Edit `src/llm_client.py`.
- Add a new async method `chat_completion(self, messages: List[dict], model: str = None) -> str`.
- This method should bypass the tool definition logic and just return the content of the assistant message.
- Use the existing `self.client.chat.completions.create` call but without `tools` argument (or with none).

### T004: Provision `manual.md`

- Copy `kitty-specs/008-intelligent-product-assistant/manual.md` to `src/assets/manual.md`.
- If the source doesn't exist, create a placeholder `src/assets/manual.md` with some dummy "How to add a lead" content.

## Definition of Done

- `src/assets/channels.yaml` exists.
- `src/config.py` can load channel settings.
- `LLMClient` has a working `chat_completion` method (verifiable via a small script or test).
- `src/assets/manual.md` is present.
